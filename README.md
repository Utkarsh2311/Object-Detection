# Object Detection script

Created a basic object detection program which detects an object coming and going out of the frame

## Usage

For windows user you will find exe file in windows folder to run the program.

## Requirements
* For linux and mac users
This will install all required files to run this program:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Note

When you open the program for the first time there should be no immediate object present infront of the camera and try to make your background as plain as possible for better results.
Thats why its still a "Basic" program
